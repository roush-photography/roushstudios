        <p><font color="#330000" face="Trajan Pro"><strong><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
          Mentoring Program is a new program set up for Photographers that feel 
          they need and want some help but are not sure where to start. It is 
          also perfect for the photographer who feels he/she is beyond being a 
          beginner and doesn't want an entry level photography course. <br>
          <br>
          Some photographers are somewhere in the middle and often don't fit the 
          mold of an online course or a predefined photo program. With this program 
          we can communicate &quot;live&quot; via phone / Skype / or one-on-one 
          at minimum of two and a maximum of five times per month. We can talk 
          about the problems and difficulties you might have with equipment or 
          techniques instead of skipping over them like you may have already done. 
          <br>
          <br>
          If you want me to travel to your location (within reason) I can do so 
          for minimal travel expense reimbursement. Every town has a coffee shop 
          we can use as our meeting place. Often times during these meetings we 
          can actually shoot photos that are part of our lessons. Wouldn't that 
          be a great way to learn?</font></strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#330000" face="Trajan Pro"><strong><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also 
          added to this program is a &quot;free&quot; consulation where you and 
          I can talk and evaluate what it is you need to study, if anything. I 
          have had a lot of folks want to sit down and talk with me about buying 
          a new camera, some new lenses, some lighting gear, and/or any other 
          photographic gear. This is a topic we can discuss during this meeting. 
          <br>

        <p><font color="#330000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Here's 
          how this program works -</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#330000"><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. 
          When you sign up you're sent a simple questionnaire to fill out. This 
          helps me know where you stand on your photographic education, what photo 
          gear you have at your disposal, and your computer skills (Photoshop 
          included).</font></strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#330000"><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. 
          Our first meeting / person to person discussion is about your gear (this 
          can be in person or over the phone / skype). I need to know what you 
          know about this equipment, so this is somewhat a fact-finding mission 
          on my part.<br>
          <br>
          3. I develop a personalized and definded program for you to follow based 
          on the above knowlegde. It will be simple; you get lessons and assignments. 
          You will do the assignments and send them to me to critique. If you 
          do them right we move on. If you don't do them right we do them again. 
          Before we start this program we review my suggestions about the educational 
          program I've developed, so you know what you're in for over the next 
          few months. We go slow, as to make sure you have the time to properly 
          do the lessons and assignments. I can deliver lessons to you in what 
          ever format you perfer. I can email them to you and you can read them, 
          we can do them over the phone / Skype / or in person, or both. </font></strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#330000"><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. 
          At the end of the 12 month period we re-evaluate your photographic knowledge 
          and decide together if we need to continue on or if you are at a place 
          where you can continue on without me. I also have a &quot;limited&quot; 
          mentor program if you want to keep the communication channels open for 
          future months / years.</font></strong></font></p>
